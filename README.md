# Burgers' Equation with Variable Boundary Conditions

This repository houses the necessary code to produce the results outlined in the included report.
Since great effort has been put towards outlining the steps taken to numerically solve this equation, the viewer is referred to the `/report` directory, where the source `.tex` files can be processed using *LuaLaTeX*.

To view the published report, see <https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2483416>.

## Code

All code was written using Python3.
To run all cases sequentially, use the provided `run_cases.txt` file by opening a terminal and typing `bash run_cases.txt`.
